---

## 🎯 CUSTOMER JOURNEY ANALYSIS

### Current Pain Points
1. **NO VISUAL APPEAL** - Zero product imagery. Customers can't see what they're ordering.
2. **INFORMATION OVERLOAD** - Everything appears at once. Overwhelming.
3. **NO SOCIAL PROOF** - Missing testimonials, reviews, or credibility signals.
4. **UNCLEAR VALUE PROP** - What makes BUBA special? Why choose us?
5. **BORING FLAVOR SELECTION** - Plain text descriptions don't entice.
6. **NO URGENCY/SCARCITY** - Nothing drives immediate action.
7. **WEAK HEADER** - Missing key info (location, hours, contact).
8. **NO TRUST SIGNALS** - No guarantees, certifications, or reassurance.

## 🎨 VISUAL DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

### Color Psychology
- Keep bold **#E10600** red (urgency, appetite, energy)
- Add **warm accents** - Golden yellows (#F4C430) for premium feel
- Use **food photography** with vibrant colors
- **White space** - Let content breathe

### Typography Hierarchy
- Keep bold uppercase for headers (current style works!)
- Add **hierarchy** - H1 > H2 > H3 clearly distinct
- Readable body text - Increase line height to 1.6
- **Number emphasis** - Make prices, stats stand out

### Imagery Strategy
- **Hero image** - Overhead shot of both boxes, fully loaded
- **Box close-ups** - Show the beautiful layered pastry
- **Flavor photos** - Individual bureka shots, each flavor
- **Event photos** - Happy customers, catered events
- **Ingredient shots** - Fresh produce, homemade sauces
- **Behind-the-scenes** - Kitchen, baking process (trust)

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover effects** - Boxes lift slightly, shadows deepen
- **Selection feedback** - Satisfying animations when choosing flavors
- **Loading states** - Smooth transitions, never jarring
- **Error states** - Friendly, helpful (not scary red)

## 📱 MOBILE-FIRST CONSIDERATIONS
- **Thumb-friendly buttons** - Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Simplified navigation** - No tiny links
- **Fast loading** - Optimize all images
- **Sticky CTA** - Submit button always accessible
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Less visible at once
